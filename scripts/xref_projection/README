GENE NAME AND XREF PROJECTION
==============================

Introduction
------------

Gene display xrefs and GO terms are projected between species, using homology information from the Ensembl Compara database. This means that species that have little or no such data can have gene names and GO terms assigned based on homology with species that have more data, typically human and mouse.


Prerequisites
-------------

The projection script needs all the core databases to be on ens-staging, xref mapping to be finished and the Compara homologies to be available. The homologies are generally available in a database of their own at "Compara hands over Homologies" (a few days before Final Compara handover) so keep in contact with the Compara team to find out when they're ready (contact Compara approximately a week before homologies are handed over to remind them to let us know when they are ready) .

Also check that the "GeneStatus" healthchecks are fixed for all the Core databases.

When you run the projections the previous projections are deleted by default. You can switch off deletion of projections in the submit_projections.pl script.

The script is now using the GOA webservice to check GO term against GOA blacklist. You need to add the following variable to your environment to make it work:

setenv http_proxy http://cache.internal.sanger.ac.uk:3128
 
or in bash:
 
export=http_proxy http://cache.internal.sanger.ac.uk:3128

If you don't have this variable, the sanger proxy will reject connections to any http website and all the jobs will died.

Running the projection
----------------------

Check out the latest version of the ensembl, ensembl-production and ensembl-compara modules from CVS. The scripts referred to here are in the ensembl-production/scripts/xref_projection directory.

The script which actually does the projection is called project_display_xrefs.pl; however this is not the one that will be run during the release cycle. The script to run is called submit_projections.pl. This uses LSF to run all the projections concurrently. The projections which are run can be found by looking in submit_projections.pl itself. 

The steps to run the projection are as follows:

1. You need to add any new species to the projection list in the submit_projections.pl script, first check with compara where is the best place to add any new species, then add them into the projection lists using the species.alias value from the core database meta table. Finally commit the file to cvs.

2. Run submit_projections.pl. It will submit all the Farm jobs and then exit. By default the script will run on ens-staging1 and ens-staging2, if you want to run the projections on another server use the -host1 and -host2 parameters. If user2 and pass2 are not defined, the script will use user1 and pass1.

perl submit_projections.pl -user1 username -pass1 xxxx -compara_host compara1 -compara_dbname mm14_compara_homology_73 -base_dir /lustre/scratch109/ensembl/USERNAME/projections

3. Monitor the progress of the run using bjobs. The lsload command is useful for monitoring the load on the server where the databases are being modified (typically ens-staging):

        lsload -s | grep myens_staging

The gene name (display_xref) projections typically start to finish after about 20 minutes, while the GO term projections take longer.

Load limit 200 (reasonable).

Results
-------

As jobs finish, they write .out and .err files to the working directory specified in the script. If a job finished successfully, the .err file will be of zero size (but will exist). .err files of non-zero length indicate that something has gone wrong.

Note that if you need to re-run individual jobs, the command-line for doing so is at the top of the appropriate .out file.

All databases that have been projected to should be healthchecked; in particular CoreForeignKeys and the xrefs group of healthchecks should be run. To do this, check out the ensj-healthcheck module, cd into ensj-healthcheck, configure database.properties, then run

./run-healthcheck.sh -d '.*_core_58.*' CoreForeignKeys core_xrefs

Once all the projections have been run and checked, inform the release coordinator.
