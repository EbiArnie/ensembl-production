<p>These data will be represented as ResultSet, with the individual features being handled by the new DNAMethylationFeature and DNAMethylationFeatureAdaptor classes. The underlying data storage is handled via bigBed files, which are available within the set 'data files', now part of the regular Ensembl release (see ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/data_files/).</p>\
<p>Configuration of the new integrated DNA Methylation data will be handled in the same way as the old external data, i.e. via the DNA Methylation configuration panel menu.&nbsp;</p>\
<p>Summary of data sets:</p>\
<ul>\
<li>Whole-genome bisulphite maps for human h1ESC and IMR90 cell types from Lister et, al., Nature 2009. &nbsp;</li>\
<li>44 human ENCODE RRBS set (previously available via DAS).</li>\
<li>Two mouse whole-genome bisulphite data sets are provided for ES and NP cell lines from Stadler et. al., Nature 2011.</li>\
